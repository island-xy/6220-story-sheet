Over the past 20 years, Baltimore's policies on drugs and crime have undergone several changes. In 2005, the Baltimore city government attempted to adopt a zero-tolerance attitude towards crime. This approach received mixed reviews, with some believing that it effectively combated crime and increased arrest efficiency, while others thought that this high-pressure strategy exacerbated tensions between the police and the community. In 2021, Baltimore adjusted its policy, adopting a more gentle and inclusive approach by deciding not to prosecute prostitution, drug possession, and other minor crimes. This decision reflects the city's new strategy in dealing with drug and crime issues, aiming to reduce the burden on the judicial system.

This article will analyze the unexpected effects of changes in Baltimore's crime policies over the past two decades by comparing the number of criminal cases, the distribution of crime locations, and the proportion of serious crimes.
